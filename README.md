# ‘Biological Males’ and the ‘Transgender Ideology’: Referring Expressions and their Role in Transphobic Discourse on Breitbart

## About the Project

In light of a recent spike in anti-transgender legislation and sentiment in the American political sphere, this project examines how referring expressions are used in online publications to (de)legitimize transgender identities. Using purpose-built corpora from Breitbart and the queer publication PinkNews, I show that Breitbart engages in the creation and proliferation of narratives that present trans people, and in particular trans women, as threats to the safety of Americans, particularly (cisgender) women and children. This is achieved by positioning them as adherents to a ‘transgender ideology’ forced on children and other Americans that refutes the notion of ‘biological sex’ and allows ‘biological males’ access to women’s spaces. I then show how variation in the domain of referring expressions that denote transgender individuals (e.g. ‘biological male’ vs. ‘trans(gender) woman’) is driven both by contextually-bound utterance utility and politically-motivated ideologies. These results indicate a need for the integration of social goals and ideologies into our understanding of referring expression production, and illuminate the ways in which trans individuals and their experiences are denigrated and delegitimzed.
