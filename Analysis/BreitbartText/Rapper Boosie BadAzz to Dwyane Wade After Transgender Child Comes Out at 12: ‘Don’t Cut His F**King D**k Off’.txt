“That is a male. A 12-year-old,” the rapper continued. “At twelve, they don’t even know what they next meal gon’ be. They don’t have shit figured out yet. He might meet a woman — anything — at sixteen and fall in love with her. But his dick be gone — how he gon’ — like, bro, you going too far, dawg.”

Booise went on to advise Wade against removing his child’s penis.

“Don’t cut his fucking dick off, Dwyane Wade, bro,” concluded the rapper. “You fucking tripping, dawg. You tripping, dawg. You tripping, dawg.”

Wade and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union, have not yet disclosed any details surrounding past — or upcoming — plans for Zaya with regards to gender reassignment surgery, according to a report by The Blast.
