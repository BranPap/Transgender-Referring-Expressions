Teen Reality TV Star Jazz Jennings Celebrates Sex Change: ‘I’m Going to Have a Vagina’

Transgender reality TV star and LGBTQ activist Jazz Jennings took to social media to gush about an upcoming penis-to-vagina gender reassignment surgery, telling fans “this is something I’ve wanted my entire life.”

“I’m going to have new genitalia,” Jennings said in the video. “Penis to vagina. That’s some serious s**t, y’all. I am just … I can’t believe it. I’m going to have a vagina.”

But Jennings did find one thing to miss about having a penis.

“The one sad thing is — peeing stand up is so cool,” the 17-year-old said. “I don’t think I’ve appreciated it enough to be able pee standing up … Honestly when you wake up in the morning and you’re lazy as hell and you’re tired, it’s the most convenient thing to do. I keep the toilet seat up … right when I go in I don’t have to touch all that slimy juice underneath the toilet seat. I just do it and sometimes I don’t even have to wash my hands if I don’t like touch anything.”

“This is something I’ve wanted my entire life,” Jennings added saying that this was a goal set at the age of three.

“Overall, I feel like the results are gonna be good. Hopefully, it’ll turn out well,” the TV personality concluded.

Jennings has been celebrated by LGBTQ activists. In 2014, Jennings co-wrote a children’s picture book called I Am Jazz and also wrote a memoir called, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen. Last year, New York toymaker Tonner Doll Company released a $90 doll for children ages eight and up based on Jennings.
