Biological Man Wins Women’s World Cycling Championship

A biological man won a women’s cycling event at the UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships on Saturday.

According to Pink News, Dr. Rachel McKinnon, a biological male who works as an assistant professor at the College of Charleston, has “faced backlash” for winning the women’s event, with people “accusing her of having an unfair advantage over her opponents.”

Lots of transphobic bigots are responding to my world championship win saying that 'Next up, the paralympics.' Hey women, you realize that ALL of these people (many of them women) are comparing you to disabled people…right? Women = 'disabled men' they think. Wow. Offensive. pic.twitter.com/K5cbZgaOMc

Many sporting events now allow athletes to sign up under the gender they identify as, even if it isn’t their biological gender, including the Olympics, and there have been a number of examples of male-to-female transgender athletes beating biological women.

McKinnon is also not the first transgender woman to win women’s cycling races.
