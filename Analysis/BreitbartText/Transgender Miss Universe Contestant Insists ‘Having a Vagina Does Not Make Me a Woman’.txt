Transgender Miss Universe Contestant Insists ‘Having a Vagina Does Not Make Me a Woman’

Miss Spain, Angela Ponce, the first transgender contestant for the Miss Universe contest, claims she was a woman before having a vagina.

In a video posted by Agence France-Presse, Ponce insisted that vaginas don’t make the woman.



Ponce insists that being a woman is only a state of mind and not a matter of actual, physical attributes.

Despite these claims that being a woman is only in one’s mind, Ponce did complete the physical transformation into becoming a woman by completing a major sex change surgery in 2014, a Miss Universe bio page reports.

Even though Ponce did not come anywhere near winning the pageant, Miss Universe officials did produce a special feature for the transgender contestant in a segment entitled “a walk to remember.”
