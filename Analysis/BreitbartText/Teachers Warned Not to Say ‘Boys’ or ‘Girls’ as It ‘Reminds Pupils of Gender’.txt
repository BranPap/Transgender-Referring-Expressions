Teachers Warned Not to Say ‘Boys’ or ‘Girls’ as It ‘Reminds Pupils of Gender’

Teachers should avoid calling female pupils “girls” or “ladies” because it means they are “constantly reminded of their gender”, a former government mental health tsar has said.

She told the Girls’ School Association’s annual conference in Manchester that she would “never walk into a room in an all-girls’ school and say ‘girls’ or ‘ladies’” because it is “patronising”.

“I don’t think it is useful to be constantly reminded of your gender all the time and all the stereotypes that go with it.”

The word “girls” can “create a lot of anxiety” in female children and teenagers, she claimed, while the word “boys” carries connotations of “being macho, not talking about your feelings, being told to man up”.

“So I hope that in taking away the negative stereotypes associated with gender, we can ultimately improve their mental health.”

On the transgender issue, she added: “There are some schools I go into that are single-sex schools, but there are transgender students in the year… You can’t presume that because somebody presents as a gender that that’s what they are.”

Last year, a parliamentary report into transgenderism called for all teachers to have “gender identity awareness training” and demanded that “trans issues” become “mandatory” in schools.

Since then, The Good Schools Guide has said it will rank how “transgender-friendly” institutions are and drag queens have been brought into nurseries to teach transgender issues to infants.
