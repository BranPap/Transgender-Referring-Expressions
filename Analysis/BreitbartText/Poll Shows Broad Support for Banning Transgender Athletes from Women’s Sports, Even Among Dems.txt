Politico wrote about its poll and credited former President Donald Trump for growing opposition:

Former President Donald Trump railed against transgender athletes in female sports in his CAPC speech a few weeks ago. Other prominent voices on the right have joined in, calling it an example of political correctness having a real-world impact.

The poll was conducted March 6-8 on a national sample of 1,990 registered voters reached online and has a margin of error of plus or minus percentage points.
