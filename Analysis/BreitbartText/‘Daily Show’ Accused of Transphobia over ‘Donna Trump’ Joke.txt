‘Daily Show’ Accused of Transphobia over ‘Donna Trump’ Joke

Comedy Central’s Daily Show has been blasted on social media and accused of ridiculing transgender people after the show’s official Twitter account cracked a joke about President Donald Trump transitioning into a woman.

The four hypothetical headlines were “Trump uses Constitution as a KFC napkin,” “Comey drops a complete ‘visual album,'” “Ivanka requests immunity,” and “Donald Trump announces he is now Donna Trump.”



Some users noted the joke was particularly offensive because it was made on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia & Biphobia.

Of course the Daily Show ran a lazy transphobic joke on the Intl Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia / the day Chelsea is free

SNL used homophobia to "make fun" of trump and the Daily Show used transphobia today to the same ends. There must be a better way.

Literally the easiest target in the ENTIRE WORLD and you go for a trans joke?

It's using us as a punch line which directly contributes to a climate where other bigots think they can murder us without consequences.

One Twitter user recalled former Daily Show host Jon Stewarts harsh joke toward transgender people.

Speaking of the Daily Show and transphobia this from 2003 seems relevant. Also props to @Dennis_Kucinich pic.twitter.com/Z8CKnGTdUZ

The show’s official Twitter account has since deleted the joke.

Neither the show nor its host Trevor Noah offered an immediate comment to address the situation.
