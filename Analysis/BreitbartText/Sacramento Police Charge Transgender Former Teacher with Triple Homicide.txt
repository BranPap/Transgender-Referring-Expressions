Sacramento Police Charge Transgender Former Teacher with Triple Homicide

A former teacher-turned-transgender woman and LGBT activist who sued a California school district for discrimination has been arrested and accused of a triple homicide, police report.

Oakland police arrested Dana Rivers, 61, of San Jose in connection with a triple murder. Dead are Patricia Wright, 57, Charlotte Reed, 56, and 19-year-old Toto Diambu, found stabbed and shot to death in a home on November 11.

Police say that after murdering the three victims, Rivers set the Oakland home on fire at about 12:30 a.m. on Friday, November 11.

Rivers was discovered with a gun, ammunition, and a knife used in the murder, according to police reports.

Media outlets quickly discovered that the suspect was once named David Warfield, a teacher at Center High School in Antelope, California. In the 1990s, Warfield began to transition into a female and eventually sued the school system for discrimination.

After an earlier announcement of his intention to transition into a woman, Warfield was suspended from teaching in 1999 and soon sued because of the school system’s decision. Later going by the name Dana Rivers, the former teacher won a $150,000 settlement from the school system.
