Caitlyn Jenner Halloween Costume Removed from Amazon Following Complaints

A Caitlyn Jenner parody Halloween costume has been removed from Amazon following complaints from LGBT groups.

Before the costume’s removal, Beaumont Society president Jane Hamlin declared, “I am astonished that a transphobic costume mocking Caitlyn Jenner is being marketed in the way it is. It is completely tasteless.”

LGBT rights group Stonewall went one step further and claimed the costume “should be taken off the shelves.”

“This is a reminder of how much is left to do to combat the abuse trans people face every day,” Stonewall declared. “This costume reduces a marginalized group to the butt of a joke. It should be taken off the shelves.”

Following the complaints, the costume’s seller, Costume Agent, reportedly removed the item from Amazon.

“The Costume Agent team has removed the Caitlyn Jenner Halloween costume effective immediately,” announced a Costume Agent spokesman. “We heard the concerns of those who were offended and the costume is no longer available on the site.”

Despite the removal, other Amazon sellers are still offering different versions of a Caitlyn Jenner costume.
