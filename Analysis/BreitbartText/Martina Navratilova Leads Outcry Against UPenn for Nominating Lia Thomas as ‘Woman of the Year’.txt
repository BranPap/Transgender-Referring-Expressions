Martina Navratilova Leads Outcry Against UPenn for Nominating Lia Thomas as ‘Woman of the Year’

Tennis star Martina Navratilova led a chorus of disapproval against the University of Pennsylvania for nominating transgender swimmer Lia Thomas for the NCAA’s “Woman of the Year” award.

Not enough fabulous biological women athletes, NCAA?!? What is wrong with you?!!!!!!!? https://t.co/5QAJyt0Qab

Being the real girl in that photo and also University of Kentucky's nominee for NCAA WOTY, this is yet another slap in the face to women. First a female national title and now nominated for the pinnacle award in collegiate athletics. The @NCAA has made this award worthless. https://t.co/MRCieqbltd

Former NCAA champion swimmer Marshi Smith was also on the attack against the nomination of Thomas for the award, adding, “How many women’s awards are we willing to surrender? The Ivy League choosing a male as their nominee is doubling down on their anti-woman campaign.”

The NCAA allows each participating college to nominate two nominees for the award, as long as one of the nominees is a woke candidate who is either from a protected class or a minority.

Thomas, who competed on the school’s men’s team for three uninspiring seasons, leaped to the top of nearly every category and took first place in the women’s 500-yard freestyle event in the NCAA’s swimming championship this year.
