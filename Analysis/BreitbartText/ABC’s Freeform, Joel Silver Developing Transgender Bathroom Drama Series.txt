ABC’s Freeform, Joel Silver Developing Transgender Bathroom Drama Series

Freeform network, formerly known as ABC Family, is developing a drama series that follows a transgender student’s fight to use the girl’s bathroom at school.

Variety reports the teen-friendly network has ordered a script for New People, which is a series based on the New York Times bestselling  novel Becoming Nicole: The Transformation of an American Family.

… Becoming Nicole is about a transgender girl who triumphed in a landmark discrimination case in 2014, successfully suing the Orono school district in Maine for barring her from using the girls’ bathroom. But the real movement in this book happens internally, in the back caverns of each family member’s heart and mind …

More on the plot from Good Reads:

Becoming Nicole chronicles a journey that could have destroyed a family but instead brought it closer together. It’s the story of a mother whose instincts told her that her child needed love and acceptance, not ostracism and disapproval; of a Republican, Air Force veteran father who overcame his deepest fears to become a vocal advocate for trans rights; of a loving brother who bravely stuck up for his twin sister; and of a town forced to confront its prejudices, a school compelled to rewrite its rules, and a courageous community of transgender activists determined to make their voices heard…

Writer Don Roos is producing New People, along with Joel Silver and and Rodney Ferrell, and Lionsgate Television and Silver Pictures.
