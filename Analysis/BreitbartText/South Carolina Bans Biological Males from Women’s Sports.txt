South Carolina Bans Biological Males from Women’s Sports

South Carolina joined the chorus of states that have banned biological males from competing in women’s sports, another hit against radical transgender ideology.

I think the girls ought to play girls and the boys ought to play boys. That’s the way we’ve always done it,” he said earlier this month.

Asked if he meant biological boys, the governor responded, “Are there any other kind?”

Henry McMaster previously signaled his support when he criticized the NCAA for barring states that protect women’s sports from hosting championships.

Opponents of the bill denounced the new law as a cruel act of bigotry against LGBTQ students.

“Transgender youth are not a threat to fairness in sports, and this law now needlessly stigmatizes young people who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence, make friends, and build skills like teamwork and leadership, winning and losing,” said activist Ivy Hill.

“It is true that your girls will have a level playing field,” she said. “They will get the chance to compete only against other biological females, as reflected on their birth certificate, because we want them to have a chance to be successful.”

In March, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed a bill that will require athletes to compete on school, college, and university sports teams corresponding to their biological sex, which was followed by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) signing a similar bill into law.
