Poll: Most Voters Support Florida Bill Banning Inappropriate Classroom Discussions for K-3

Most voters support Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Thursday found.

When asked about the bill in an honest manner, a majority of voters support it. Rasmussen Reports asked:

The relevant passage of the new Florida law reads: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” Would you support or oppose such a law in your state?

When given the full context, 62 percent of voters say they would support a similar law in their state, and of those, 45 percent said they would “strongly” support it.
