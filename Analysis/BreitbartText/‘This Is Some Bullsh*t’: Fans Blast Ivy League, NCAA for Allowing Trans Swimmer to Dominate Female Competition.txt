‘This Is Some Bullsh*t’: Fans Blast Ivy League, NCAA for Allowing Trans Swimmer to Dominate Female Competition

University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer Lia Thomas smashed the women’s 500-yard freestyle record at the Ivy League Championships Thursday while cruising to a first-place finish.

Video of the trans swimmer’s domination quickly began making the rounds on the internet.

90% of people know it's bullshit, they're just afraid to say it.

500 free final @IvyLeague championships: Lia Thomas, formerly of the @PennSwimDive men's team, won by over 7 seconds. You can hardly see the other women swimming at the far end of the pool by the time the race is over. For the women, "it was a race for second place." pic.twitter.com/3ItZnsGMtR

Lia Thomas is a biological male swimming against biological females. Whether she identifies as a girl is irrelevant to the fact that she was born a male, went through puberty as a male, and swam on the mens team for 3 years. Protect women’s sports.

ESPN weighed in with a startling grasp of the obvious. Though, they stopped short of saying exactly why Thomas enjoyed such a strength advantage over the rest of the field:

.@ESPN: "You can see the …powerful stroke of Lia Thomas where there isn't a whole lot of movement in her legs. …it's a much quieter stroke even though it's more powerful than a lot of these other swimmers right now."  @SaveWomensSport @AbigailShrier @KDansky @coachblade pic.twitter.com/fOr3piBep6

Congratulations to Catherine Buroker, who might have come second in this race, but as she lost to trans woman Lia Thomas (born a man) Catherine is the real winner here 👏🏻🏊‍♀️ https://t.co/TgnPDn4mML

UPenn swimmer “Lia” Thomas is just a horrible human being.

He knows he’s destroying the sport for women, but the mentally ill spoiled brat couldn’t care less. 

Shame on the @NCAA for destroying the championship and erasing all the hard work real women put in.

The “scrutiny” you’re referring to is noticing that Lia Thomas is not a woman competing in women’s events. https://t.co/bDLEKyWgHI

Lia Thomas is cheating. https://t.co/tEbXQgyZha

Genuine question. Because it only takes one Lia Thomas in each event for women's sports to be meaningless, long-standing records trashed. This is the future, so the LGBT-lobby who have pushed this through need to think of an answer #whatdowesaytothegirls
