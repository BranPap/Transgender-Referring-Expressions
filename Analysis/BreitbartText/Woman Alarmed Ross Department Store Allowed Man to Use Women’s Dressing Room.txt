Woman Alarmed Ross Department Store Allowed Man to Use Women’s Dressing Room

A shocked female customer of a Ross department store in Texas is criticizing a manager’s decision to allow a man to use the women’s changing room earlier this week.

“She went inside the dressing room, came right back out and called me to the side and told me … he was representing himself as a woman today,” Stickles told Dallas/Fort Worth’s CBS affiliate.

That was not good enough for Stickles, however. “What about me? Or my feelings?” she asked.

“(The manager) told me that if I felt uncomfortable in the dressing room with him there … I’d have to wait until he’s finished,” she added.

The customer apparently did not believe the man was transgender. “He was in no way dressed as a woman,” she said. “He had on jeans, a t-shirt, 5 o’clock shadow, very deep voice. He was a man.”

The customer’s worry evokes shadows of the argument many make against these pro-transgender policies. If the woman’s story is to be believed, a man who had not attempted to observe a transgender lifestyle simply decided to use the women’s changing room for a seemingly illegitimate reason.
