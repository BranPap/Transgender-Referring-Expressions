Target Collaborates with ‘Queer-Owned’ Brand to Sell Chest Binders

Target stores, which are no stranger to political controversy, are wading in the waters yet again, collaborating with what has been described as “queer-owned” brands to assist in normalizing radical transgender ideology by selling chest binders — apparel to flatten women’s chests.

“We are a queer-founded brand dedicated to empowering our LGBTQ+ community year-round, and advocating for equal representation and celebration of all people,” the brand states, offering products for “all bodies and needs, of all sizes and across the gender spectrum.” “Gender Euphoria” is one of its signature collections, and includes “tucking” bikini bottoms as well as “compression” tops, or chest binders.

Notably, in 2015, Target opted to make the toy section “gender neutral,” moving away from “gender-based signs” to “help strike a better balance.”
