Actor Laurence Fox Comes Out as ‘Trans-Racial Actress’, Asks to Play Winnie Mandela

Cancelled actor Laurence Fox jokingly claimed that he is now a “trans-racial actress of colour” and that he is looking to finally win an Oscar for portraying the widow of Nelson Mandela.

“I am a woman. My name is Lauren Foxx and I am a trans-racial actress of colour looking to play Winnie Mandela in a film for which I expect an Oscar,” the Reclaim Party leader wrote.

“It’s time to push back against the systemic misogyny and transphobia in the show business community,” he jibed.

Following the very public cancellation of his acting career, Mr Fox established the Reclaim Party in order to combat all things woke in Britain, later launching a bid to run for Mayor of London against leftist Labour incumbent Sadiq Khan.

On Thursday, the campaigner took aim at Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak for failing to be able to define what a woman is.

Appearing on talkRadio, the Conservative Party politician was apparently stumped by hostess Julia Hartley-Brewer, who asked the Chancellor simply: “What is a woman?”.

At Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons, Johnson had said that while sensitivity and love should be afforded to those seeking to change their gender, “When it comes to distinguishing between a man and a woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important.”

He does not appear to be considering any actual legislation at strengthening protections for women’s spaces or the right to challenge transgender ideology without being cancelled or possibly pursued by law enforcement for “hate speech”, however.

Mocking Sunak’s inability to define what a woman is other than ‘what he said’, Laurence Fox quipped: “A woman is an adult human female, Rishi. It’s not complicated.”

“Ps. Lia Thomas is a man. Pass it on,” Fox said of a transgender swimmer who recently won the NCAA 500-yard freestyle championship against biologically female opponents.

Who is telling these puppets what is acceptable speech?

Someone needs to send @RishiSunak back to key stage one.

A woman is an adult human female, Rishi.

It’s not complicated.

Ps. Lia Thomas is a man.

Pass it on. pic.twitter.com/Jnm2E3x3QC
