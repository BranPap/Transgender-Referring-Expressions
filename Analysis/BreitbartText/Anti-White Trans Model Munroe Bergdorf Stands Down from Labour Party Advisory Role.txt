Anti-White Trans Model Munroe Bergdorf Stands Down from Labour Party Advisory Role

Munroe Bergdorf, a transgender model who was fired from L’Oreal last year after publishing an anti-white rant, has resigned from her role as LGBT adviser to the UK’s Labour Party.

“Following last week’s exciting announcement that I had accepted a place on the LGBT advisory board assembled to offer counsel to Dawn Butler MP, the Labour Party’s Women and Equalities Minister, it is with great sadness that I have decided to step down from the position,” Bergdorf declared. “This is a decision I’ve made due to endless attacks on my character by the Conservative right-wing press and relentless online abuse. I refuse to be painted as a villain or used as a pawn in the press’ efforts, especially those at the Daily Mail, to discredit the Labour Party or discredit their transphobic rightist agendas.”

Following her appointment, Bergdorf faced numerous calls to resign from Conservative Party MPs, including Helen Grant MP.

In Bergdorf’s rant against white people, which was published on Facebook last year, the model called whites “the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth.”

“Your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. Your entire existence is drenched in racism,” she continued, before doubling down on the comments in an interview.

Conservative Party MP James Cleverly celebrated Bergdorf’s resignation, while left-wing commentator Dan Hodges mocked the model for blaming others over her own words.

Munroe Bergdorf shows no contrition or self awareness. 

Blames the media for reporting the vile comments that she has made over a number of years.

My criticism of her was based solely on what she said, not who she is. https://t.co/ihIeRZxxbl

Utterly shameful the way the press have forced Munroe Bergdorf to resign by accurately reporting her words. It’s this sort of gutter journalism that will end when Jeremy Corbyn becomes PM…
