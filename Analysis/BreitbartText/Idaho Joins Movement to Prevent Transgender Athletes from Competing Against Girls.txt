Idaho Joins Movement to Prevent Transgender Athletes from Competing Against Girls

A lawmaker in Idaho is joining legislators in crafting legislation to protect female athletes from having to compete against biological males in school sports.

Republican State Representative Barbara Ehardt told a local news outlet that she will introduce the bill that requires individuals to compete in women’s sports based on their biological sex not their gender identity.

The news outlet reported on Ehardt’s bill: 

Ehardt says this bill is meant to protect women and girls. However, she said the language of the bill focuses on DNA and chromosomes, meaning that it does not single out biological males. Biological females would be prevented from competing in men’s sports as well, she said.

“Those biological boys, those men, can still compete (in sports), it will just have to be with those who look like them, that have the same large heart and lungs,” Ehardt said, adding that the bill is not about homosexual rights.

Ehardt’s is also working on another bill from last year’s legislative session that she will re-introduce. The bill would allow parents to decide if their children are enrolled in sex education curriculum.
