Texas Court Blocks Abbott’s Child Abuse Investigation into Parents of Transgender Children

A Texas judge blocked the state’s child abuse investigation into the parents of a transgender child pursuant to a directive issued by Gov. Greg Abbott (R).

Abbott implemented this directive last week after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal option that said gender-affirming health care is considered child abuse under Texas law.

However, Travis County District Court Judge Amy Clark Meachum on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order preventing the state from investigating the parents of a transgender child.

According to the judge, the plaintiffs “face the imminent and ongoing deprivation of their constitutional rights, the potential loss of necessary medical care, and the stigma attached to being the subject of an unfounded child abuse investigation.”

Judge Meachum said Mooney would have faced either criminal liability for not reporting child abuse or civil liability for not treating patients “in accordance with professional standards and loss of licensure for failing to follow her professional ethics.”

The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal brought the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs.

President Joe Biden chimed in on Abbott’s directives, calling them “a cynical and dangerous campaign targeting transgender children and their parents.”

Judge Meachum will decide whether Abbott’s directive would be blocked statewide on March 11. Currently, the ruling applies only to the anonymous parents in the lawsuit.

The case is Jane Doe v. Abbott, No. D-1-GN-22-000977 in the District Court of Travis County.
