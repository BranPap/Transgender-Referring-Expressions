Poll: Plurality Oppose Allowing Parents to Give Children Puberty-Blocking Drugs

A plurality of Americans do not believe parents should be able to provide their children, who claim to be transgender, with puberty-blocking drugs, a survey from The Economist/YouGov found.

The survey asked if they supported or opposed the following: “Allowing parents to provide their transgender children or teenagers with puberty-blocking drugs, which can temporarily prevent the effects of puberty that may not align with their gender identity?”

“Here’s what I can tell you. In the state of Florida, we are not going to allow them to inject transgenderism into kindergarten,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said last week.

“First graders shouldn’t have woke gender ideology imposed in their curriculums, and that is what we’re standing for. We’re standing for the kids and we’re standing for the parents,” he added.
