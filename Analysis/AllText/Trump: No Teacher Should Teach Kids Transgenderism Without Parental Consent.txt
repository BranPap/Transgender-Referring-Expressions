“Isn’t it amazing how that’s become such a big subject? And who would even think that’d be such a big subject?” he added.

The 45th president of the United States made similar statements in Selma, North Carolina earlier this month.

“A Republican Congress must stand up for parental rights and parental choice. I think that’s a good idea. No teacher should ever be allowed to teach far left gender theories to our children without parental consent,” Trump said at a rally, according to Business Insider.

Florida recently passed a law banning the discussion of gender and sexual orientation to children from kindergarten through 3rd grade, which leftists dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The Biden administration has claimed the bill was designed to” LGBTQI+ kids.”

As Breitbart News’ Joel Pollak reported, the bill does not mention the word “gay” or reference any particular sexual orientation.

Trump also called to get transgender athletes out of women’s sports.
