Grindr Update Adds ‘More Inclusive’ Features for ‘Non-Binary’, Trans People

An update for popular gay dating app Grindr adds new features that aim to be “more inclusive” for non-binary and transgender users.

According to Tech Crunch, “Grindr’s new identity section lets users fill out their own gender identity or pick from a list that includes ‘trans man,’ ‘woman,’ ‘cis man,’ ‘non-binary,’ ‘non-conforming’ and ‘queer.’ Users can also select or write in what pronouns they prefer to use.”

“As the largest global queer social network, Grindr has always had trans men, trans women, and non-binary users on the app. We are proud to release these updates to our core functionality to firmly establish that we are committed to making Grindr a welcome and safe space for all trans people,” declared Grindr’s Vice President of Marketing, Peter Sloterdyk. “To ensure we heard from a range of trans people, we polled trans users and consulted transgender community leaders to guide our thinking.”

In a statement, Jack Harrison-Quintana, director for equality, also added that, “One thing we heard over and over again from trans people using Grindr was that they felt unwelcome as other users would often only want to ask them about what it means to be trans or approached without knowing how to speak respectfully about trans issues.”

Grindr’s new “written resources” include an FAQ page, which includes questions such as, “What does it mean to be non-binary?” and “Can a trans person be gay?”
