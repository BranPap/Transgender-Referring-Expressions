‘Real Housewives’ Star Bethenny Frankel Rips Woke Mob over ‘Transphobia’ Accusations: ‘I’m Not Afraid of Cancellation’

Real Housewives of New York City star Bethenny Frankel slammed woke online critics for accusing her of making “transphobic” comments, stating, “I’m not afraid of cancellation.”

At the beginning of her Thursday episode, Frankel described her young daughter’s classmates using their pronouns at school — and also lamented about political correctness at her daughter’s camp.

“I did a Zoom for my daughter’s school and [had] the pronouns conversation with each teacher, each parent, each child, and my daughter says in school, too, that everybody has to say their pronouns,” Frankel said.

Frankel went on to describe the “crazy stories” that she heard from summer camp.

“Summer camp went fucking crazy this summer,” the Just B host affirmed. “So either it was the pandemic, or everybody being politically correct — or it just happened to be the craziest year in camp history.”

Frankel explained that one story involved “a person with a penis, who identifies as being a girl, went to the camp and was in the bunk with the girls.”

“And the girls saw — because it’s a male anatomy, but identifying as a woman — so the other girls saw a penis,” she said. “They’re 9, 10 years old. So the parents obviously weren’t that happy.”

The host also surmised that “maybe a mother isn’t ready for her child to see a penis in the bunk and understand that child identifies with being a girl.”

As a result, Frankel was later attacked by LGBTQ advocates on Twitter.

“Hi Beth! I was going to quote the transphobic language you used in the horrific intro to this episode, but it’s too hurtful to even put it in writing,” one Twitter user wrote. “Maybe do the bare minimum of research before you speak to your audience?”

“Agree I’ve listened to almost every episode and this rant was completely offensive and disgusting. How dare she,” another reacted.

“Listen to the podcast. Then comment. I was absolutely not wrong,” the Real Housewives of New York City alum told a critic on Tuesday. “I’m going to discuss this again this week. Thankfully I have a platform to clarify what the media loves to distort.”

“ps. I’m not afraid of cancelation so not afraid of charged discussions,” Frankel added.

“Nominate me for cancelation,” the Just B host told another critic on Twitter. “There are like five others before you so take a number.”

True. Nominate me for cancelation…there are like five others before you so take a number.  😘 https://t.co/tGOODK5gy7
