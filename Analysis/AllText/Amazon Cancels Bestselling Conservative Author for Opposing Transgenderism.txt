Amazon Cancels Bestselling Conservative Author for Opposing Transgenderism

Big Tech has tightened its stranglehold on conservative ideas by censoring a bestselling book that undermines transgender ideology by showing its lack of scientific grounding.

Amazon has cancelled the meticulously researched book not because of any factual errors or incendiary language but because it counters the gender ideology popular in woke circles.

Anderson said that he has reached out to Amazon in an effort to find out what the tech giant found so intolerable about the book, but so far company executives have declined to respond.

Some may find it eerie that Amazon has decided to cancel one of the Equality Act’s most prominent critics, just before the controversial legislation comes to vote.

A Wall Street Journal op-ed noted Tuesday that just when tech censorship has reached unprecedented levels, two Congressional Democrats have written to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos requesting more ideological suppression of uncomfortable ideas.

“Corporate media censorship, such as Amazon’s scrubbing of a heretical book, is accelerating,” the Journal’s editors observe. “And government is right alongside, pushing for censorship with increasing force.”

Part of the problem is Big Tech’s near monopoly of the market, Anderson told Breitbart News. “It’s as if a whole bunch of booksellers all got together and decided to blacklist a book just because they disagreed with its thesis.”

“My prediction is that in the short run I’ll sell thousands more copies of the book thanks to Amazon’s censorship,” Anderson notes. “In the medium run, things will get worse for those who hold to traditional American values.”

“But in the long run, a people can struggle against the natural law for only so long,” he said.
