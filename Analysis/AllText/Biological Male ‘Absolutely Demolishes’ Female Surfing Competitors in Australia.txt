Biological Male ‘Absolutely Demolishes’ Female Surfing Competitors in Australia

A biological man who had been a prize-winning surfer as a man is now suddenly dominating women’s surfing competitions in Australia after claiming to be transgender.

Lowerson competed as Ryan Egan as recently as 2019 when he won the same championship in the men’s division. And Egan/Lowerson has now become the first person to win both the men’s and women’s championships in Australia.

I know pro's in the skateboading industry who are refusing to speak up for female athletes even though they privately complain about what's going on

its time to speak up

Males competing in women's division is the ultimate chauvinistic fuck you. The 43-year-old Sasha Jane Lowerson, who was crowned the men’s champion three years ago, just won both the Open Women’s and Open Logger divisions in Australia, by obliterating the "competition". pic.twitter.com/KhzuHfGmQl

Here in Australia, Sasha Jane Lowerson just won the womens longboard event for surfing.

Look at the difference in times. If Sasha had competed in the mens event, he would have won fair and square. Instead he took Georgia’s 1st place, denied Sam her 2nd, and Shae’s 3rd pic.twitter.com/KLQBdAf33P

Now the man, Sasha Jane Lowerson, is on there. Nice work, Sasha! You're a man, a cheat, & a misogynist.

Check out the other blokes who've competed in women's sports & marvel at how few women who identify as men compete in men's sports. #transwomenaremen#sashajanelowerson https://t.co/z0MrLbTxVR

According to people like @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner @UKLabour & other deranged Leftards, this man is actually a woman

He can call himself Sasha Jane Lowerson but we all know he’s a man. Not a woman

Here you go again. A man stealing a woman's effort.

This is pure SCAM and the society is letting these people to get away with this robbery on our humanity.
