Transgender Athletes Banned from UK Cycling Events

British Cycling, the national governing body which oversees cycling events in the UK, has banned males identifying as women from women’s cycling events.

“It is currently possible for trans-female athletes to gain eligibility to race domestically while their cases remain pending with the UCI (or indeed in situations where they are deemed ineligible),” British Cycling declared in a statement.

British Cycling’s previous policy had required males identifying as females to demonstrate testosterone levels below a certain level for one year. However, despite claiming that he satisfied that requirement, British trans cyclist Emily Bridges was banned from an upcoming event.

Authorities with British Cycling claim UCI informed them that Bridges would not be able to ride in the event because he was still registered to compete as a male in international competitions.

Trans competitors and the effects of hormone therapy have come under increased scrutiny after American swimmer Lia Thomas, a male identifying as a woman, smashed women’s swimming records and defeated multiple Olympic swimmers despite a thoroughly average record in men’s swimming and taking testosterone therapy for 2 1/2 years.

British Cycling gave a timeframe of several weeks for determining their new policy. The governing body also pledged to include representation from the transgender community in the process.
