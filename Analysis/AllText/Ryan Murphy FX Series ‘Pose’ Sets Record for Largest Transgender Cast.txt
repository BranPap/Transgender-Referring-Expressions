Ryan Murphy FX Series ‘Pose’ Sets Record for Largest Transgender Cast

Screenwriter-super producer Ryan Murphy is developing a television series that will feature the largest ever cast of transgender actors.

Producers for the series, called Pose, have reportedly finished a six-month casting search to find five transgender actors to play various characters, which will explore the contrasting lifestyles of people living in 1980’s New York.

Murphy — who has written scripts for and executive produced award-winning series such as Feud, American Horror Story, and Glee — is known for promoting LGBT issues within his shows, and is himself married to a man with two children.

“We are thrilled that ‘Pose’ pushes the narrative forward by centering on the unique and under-told experiences of trans women and gay people of color,” series co-creator Steven Canals told The Hollywood Reporter. “Ryan has assembled a strong team of storytellers and innovators to collaborate on telling this important narrative. As a Bronx-bred queer writer of color, I’m honored to aid in ushering this groundbreaking show into homes.”

The transgender-heavy project is scheduled to begin production in November.
