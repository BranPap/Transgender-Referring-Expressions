Poll: Majority of Democrats Believe Children Should Be Able to Choose Their Own Pronouns

Most Democrats believe children should be able to choose their own pronouns — a view not held by a majority of voters across the board, May’s Harvard-Harris survey found.

The survey asked, “Do you think that kids should be able to pick their pronouns — he, she or they — or do you think they should be called by their sex?”
