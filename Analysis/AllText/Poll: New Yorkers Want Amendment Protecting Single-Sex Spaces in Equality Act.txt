Poll: New Yorkers Want Amendment Protecting Single-Sex Spaces in Equality Act

New Yorkers support an amendment to the Equality Act aimed to protect single-sex spaces, such as bathrooms, locker rooms, and women’s sports, a Spry Strategies survey released this week found.

The survey, taken on behalf of the Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF), found that less than a third of New York voters, or 28 percent, support Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY)  decision to “block any amendments to the Equality Act to protect women’s spaces,” according to WoLF. The survey also shows a plurality “strongly” disagree with biological men being permitted to compete in female athletics.

“Across all party affiliations, New York voters understand that human beings cannot change sex and that it will harm women and girls to pretend otherwise,” WoLF Executive Director Natasha Chart said in a statement.

“Members of Congress must come together and act on this rare topic of bipartisan agreement and amend the Equality Act to protect women’s right to single-sex spaces,” Chart added.

The survey, taken March 12-15 among 1,000 likely voters, has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.

The Democrat-led House passed the Equality Act — which would essentially categorize “sexual orientation and gender identity” as protected classes, effectively erasing federal legal recognition and fundamental reality biological sex —  last month, 224-206.
