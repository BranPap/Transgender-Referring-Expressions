California Bakery Sparks Outrage over ‘Transgender Ken’ Cake

A California bakery is facing public criticism and customer defections over its decision to bake a controversial specialty cake featuring a transgender version of Ken, the Barbie doll’s male companion.

The bakery, which is known for its doll cakes, posted a picture of the doll cake on Facebook and started to experience a backlash, according to Marlene Goetzeler, co-owner of the bakery.



The post went viral on social media, but the bakery’s Facebook page lost dozens of “likes” and potential business as a result.

“After posting this we had a ton of people unliking our Facebook page. I deleted the rude remarks, thank goodness not too many. Our customer was thrilled. Share this for us!” the company posted.

“Naively, I guess I just thought this is a really cool cake, and look at how great they did with the butter cream,” said Goetzeler. “What’s wrong with a Ken cake?”

The customer who bought the cake said the cake was meant to be for a friend’s birthday, according to KCRA.

Chad Graham, a member of the party where the cake was served, said the cake was meant for someone who was not transgender and did not want to make a political statement.

“I thought it was a little ridiculous. It was just cake,” said Graham.
