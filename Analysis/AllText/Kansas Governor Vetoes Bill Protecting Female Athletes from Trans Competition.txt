Kansas Governor Vetoes Bill Protecting Female Athletes from Trans Competition

Kansas Governor Laura Kelly (D) vetoed a GOP-led bill on Friday that would have prevented males identifying as females from infiltrating and dominating girls’ sports.

“We all want a fair and safe place for our kids to play and compete,” Kelly wrote. “However, this bill … came from politicians trying to score political points.”

“The Fairness in Women’s Sports Act is about just that, fairness,” Kansas GOP Senate President Ty Masterson said. “It simply sets guidelines that ensure the fair playing field continues for women that we have recognized for decades.”

This week, the Republican-led legislature of Kentucky overrode Democrat Governor Andy Beshear’s veto of a similar bill to protect girls’ sports from transgender competition.

More than a dozen other states have passed bills to prevent males identifying as females from competing against females.
