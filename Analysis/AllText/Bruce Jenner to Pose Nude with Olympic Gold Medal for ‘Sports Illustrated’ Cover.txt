Bruce Jenner to Pose Nude with Olympic Gold Medal for ‘Sports Illustrated’ Cover

Transgender reality TV star and former Olympian athlete Bruce “Caitlyn” Jenner will pose nude with his 1976 gold medal for Sports Illustrated magazine.

Jenner, then a masculine track and field athlete, won the gold medal in the men’s decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

Celebrating the 39th anniversary of his impressive feat, ESPN wrote last July, “Not only was it a significant athletic achievement for the country in its bicentennial year, but the fact Jenner was able to dethrone Soviet decathlete Mykola Avilov, who had won gold in 1972 during the height of the Cold War, made it even more memorable.”

Jenner later recalled the victory and his decision to retire at the top of his game: “In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with.”

He added, “I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.”

Last April, Jenner told ABC’s Diane Sawyer he has identified as female since childhood, and soon after, he began going by the name Caitlyn and wearing feminine clothing and makeup.

After a rumored breast augmentation surgery last March, before Jenner’s public revelation, an associate of the former star athlete told RadarOnline that Jenner “went with a smaller [breast] implant because he didn’t want to look ridiculous.”

About Jenner, who was once the epitome of American masculinity, the person said, “He’s not allowed to lift anything, and he has to wear a bra 24/7, but he’s expected to resume normal activities in the next six weeks.”
