Trans Paedophile Who Identifies as 5-Year-Old Girl Attends Court Dressed as an Elf

A transgender paedophile who identifies as a 5-year-old girl has attended court dressed as an elf following a breach of his sexual harm order.

The defendant has been accused of kissing random schoolgirls on the lips between the 18th of December 2019 and the 31st of January 2021 — despite being banned from deliberately interacting with children since 2016.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided to drop three other charges that broke the sexual harm order, but have said they will remain on Verainer’s criminal file.

A sexual harm prevention order can be imposed by British courts on offenders to, supposedly, minimise the risk of and protect the public from sexual harm perpetrated by the defendant. The orders can prohibit an offender from undertaking a variety of activities, for example taking certain forms of employment, such as teaching, engaging in particular activities on the Internet, such as having social media profiles, and also from deliberately engaging with children.

A lot to pack in here.

For this latest offence, Verainer has previously attended a hearing sucking a dummy and wearing pigtails, again asking to be referred to as “she” and wearing the elf costume.

The Daily Mail reports that at Canterbury Crown Court in 2016 trial psychiatrists concluded that Verainer had personality problems but no mental health issues.

Yesterday’s court session only lasted for 15 minutes before being delayed until the 25th of February 2022, when he will now be sentenced.
