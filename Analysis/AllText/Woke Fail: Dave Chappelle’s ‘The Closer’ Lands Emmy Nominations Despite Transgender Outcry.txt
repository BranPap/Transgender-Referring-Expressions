“They cancelled @jk_rowling, they started calling her a TERF. I didn't even know what that was, but I know that trans people make up words to win arguments… I'm team TERF.”

Netflix employees staged a walkout in protest of the show, demanding the streamer yank the program from its service.



But Netflix executives have steadfastly refused to cave to their demands, no doubt in part because The Closer is one of Netflix’s most-watched comedy specials.

Earlier this year, comedian Louis CK won a Grammy Award for his comedy album Sincerely Louis C.K. The comedian was one of Hollywood’s most prominent #MeToo casualties after various female comedians accused him of masturbating in front of them.

This year’s Emmy Awards are set to take place Monday, September 12 in Los Angeles and will air on NBC.
